# AI_Research_Project_TylerM
The project uses the abalone dataset to predict the target value sex through classification. Features of the dataset, other than sex, included length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, shell weight, and rings. Implementation of the project was achieved by using the Pycaret library and following the Pycaret tutorial for classification.  The top three performing models were logistic regression, SVM-linear kernel, and ridge classifier. Notably, the best-performing model out of all of them was logistic regression based on its performance scores.
